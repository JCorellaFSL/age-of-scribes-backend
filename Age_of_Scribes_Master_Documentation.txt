        daily_production = resource_data.production_base
        daily_consumption = resource_data.consumption_base
        current_imports = resource_data.import_volume
        
        total_supply = daily_production + current_imports
        net_balance = total_supply - daily_consumption
        
        if net_balance < 0 and daily_consumption > 0:
            deficit_ratio = abs(net_balance) / daily_consumption
            quantity_needed = abs(net_balance) * 10  # 10-day buffer
            
            resource_needs[resource_type.value] = {
                'deficit_ratio': deficit_ratio,
                'quantity_needed': quantity_needed,

- Relationship tracking: rivals, allies, faction alignments

**REGIONAL GUILDS:**
Multi-settlement organizations with expanded political influence:
- Chapter guild management across multiple settlements
- Regional influence mapping and political power metrics
- Trade route control and government connections
- Unity score tracking for organizational cohesion

**GUILD EVENTS:**
Dynamic events affecting guild behavior and settlements:

VOLATILITY AND EVENT GENERATION
--------------------------------
**VOLATILITY CALCULATION:**
Event probability scales with guild instability factors:
- Base probability: 2% daily chance per guild
- Conflict status multipliers: Peaceful (1.0x) to Under Siege (2.5x)
- Stability modifier: Low stability (30) increases volatility 2.3x
- Monopoly attention: High market dominance attracts challenges
- Faction alignment risk: Political connections increase volatility

**EVENT WEIGHTING:**
Event selection based on current guild conditions:
- Power Struggle (weight 30): Triggered by stability < 50
- Monopoly Grab (weight 25): Triggered by influence > 70
- Regional Ban (weight 35): Triggered by settlement reputation < 30
- Internal Collapse (weight 40): Triggered by stability < 30

EVENT RESOLUTION MECHANICS
---------------------------
**DURATION AND SEVERITY:**
- Event duration: 7-90 days based on type and severity
- Severity scaling: 0.1-1.0 intensity affects daily impact
- Daily effects: Gradual influence/stability changes during event
- Resolution outcomes: Multiple possible endings per event type

**RESOLUTION EXAMPLES:**
Power Struggle outcomes:
- Leadership Change: Stability +10, Influence -5
- Compromise: Moderate improvements across metrics
- Schism: Guild splits, massive stability loss (-20), member exodus (-30%)

Monopoly Grab outcomes:
- Monopoly Established: Market dominance (+15 influence, +30 monopoly strength)
- Competition Emerges: Market pushback (-5 influence, -10 monopoly)

            score *= social_modifier
            
            # Memory-based learning
            memory_modifier = self.get_memory_influence(action, npc.memories)
            score *= memory_modifier
            
            action_scores[action] = score
        
        # Select highest-scoring action with some randomness
        return self.select_action_with_variance(action_scores)
```

SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP SYSTEM
---------------------------
**RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:**
- Trust levels based on interaction history
- Affection through positive shared experiences
- Respect from demonstrated competence
- Fear from power imbalances or threats

**RELATIONSHIP EVOLUTION:**
```python
def update_relationship(self, npc1: NPCProfile, npc2: NPCProfile, 
                       interaction_type: str, outcome: str):
    # Calculate relationship delta based on interaction
    trust_delta = self.calculate_trust_change(interaction_type, outcome)
    affection_delta = self.calculate_affection_change(interaction_type, outcome)
    
    # Apply personality modifiers
    trust_delta *= self.get_trust_personality_modifier(npc1, npc2)
    affection_delta *= self.get_affection_personality_modifier(npc1, npc2)
    
    # Update relationship scores
    relationship = npc1.relationships.get(npc2.name, defaultdict(float))
    relationship['trust'] += trust_delta
    relationship['affection'] += affection_delta
    
    # Store interaction in memory
    memory_event = self.create_relationship_memory(npc2, interaction_type, outcome)
    npc1.memories.append(memory_event)
```

FACTION INTEGRATION
-------------------
**LOYALTY DYNAMICS:**
- Initial loyalty based on recruitment circumstances
- Loyalty changes through faction actions and personal experiences
- Defection thresholds and consequences
- Multiple faction allegiances and conflicts

**FACTION INFLUENCE ON BEHAVIOR:**
- Faction goals influence individual NPC goals
- Faction resources provide opportunities and constraints
- Faction conflicts create social tensions
- Faction propaganda affects opinion formation

MEMORY AND LEARNING SYSTEM
---------------------------
**MEMORY CATEGORIES:**
- **Episodic**: Specific events and experiences
- **Semantic**: General knowledge and facts
- **Procedural**: Skills and behavioral patterns
- **Social**: Relationship and interaction history

**MEMORY INFLUENCE ON DECISIONS:**
```python
def get_memory_influence(self, action: str, memories: List[Memory]) -> float:
    influence = 1.0
    
    # Find relevant memories
    relevant_memories = [m for m in memories if self.is_memory_relevant(m, action)]
    
    # Weight recent memories more heavily
    for memory in relevant_memories:
        age_weight = self.calculate_memory_age_weight(memory)
        emotional_weight = memory.emotional_intensity
        
        if memory.outcome == "positive":
            influence += 0.1 * age_weight * emotional_weight
        elif memory.outcome == "negative":
            influence -= 0.1 * age_weight * emotional_weight
    
    return max(0.1, min(2.0, influence))  # Cap influence range
```

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
-------------------------
**SCALABILITY FEATURES:**
- Behavior tree caching for common scenarios
- Lazy evaluation of complex decisions
- Spatial partitioning for social interactions
- Priority queues for processing order
- Memory management for long-term simulation

**PROCESSING TARGETS:**
- 1,000 NPCs: Real-time processing
- 10,000 NPCs: Near real-time with optimizations
- 50,000 NPCs: Batch processing mode
- <5ms per NPC per decision cycle
- Efficient memory usage (~2KB per NPC)

NPC CAREER TRANSITION SYSTEM
===============================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The NPC Career Transition System enables dynamic professional mobility within
the Age of Scribes social simulation. NPCs can change careers based on their
experiences, motivations, economic pressures, and life circumstances, creating
realistic character development and economic adaptation.

INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS
----------------------------------
**MOTIVATION-DRIVEN TRANSITIONS:**
The existing motivation engine naturally supports career transitions:

- **SURVIVAL MOTIVATION**: Economic hardship drives career changes to more profitable work
- **KNOWLEDGE MOTIVATION**: Discovery of new interests leads to scholarly pursuits
- **WEALTH MOTIVATION**: Poor economic conditions motivate transitions to lucrative trades
- **FREEDOM MOTIVATION**: Restrictive work environments drive independence-seeking
- **POWER MOTIVATION**: Success creates ambition for leadership positions
- **REVENGE MOTIVATION**: Professional betrayal motivates career escapes
- **COMMUNITY MOTIVATION**: Isolation drives transitions to more social professions
- **DUTY MOTIVATION**: Personal calling drives career changes toward service

**FACTION-BASED CAREER DISRUPTION:**
```python
def evaluate_faction_career_impact(npc: NPCProfile) -> Dict[str, float]:
    career_disruption_factors = {}
    
    # Guild defection consequences
    if npc.faction_loyalty.get("professional_guild", 0) < -0.5:
        career_disruption_factors["guild_exile"] = 0.8
        npc.generate_goal("establish_independent_practice")
    
    # Professional blacklisting
    if npc.reputation_scores.get("professional", 0) < -0.6:
        career_disruption_factors["reputation_damage"] = 0.7
        npc.generate_goal("rebuild_career_in_new_field")
    
    # Faction collapse
    controlling_faction = npc.get_primary_faction()
    if controlling_faction and controlling_faction.power_level < 0.3:
        career_disruption_factors["institutional_failure"] = 0.6
        npc.generate_goal("find_alternative_employment")
    
    return career_disruption_factors
```

CAREER TRANSITION TRIGGERS
---------------------------
**ECONOMIC PRESSURE MODELING:**
```python
def evaluate_economic_pressure(npc: NPCProfile, settlement: Settlement) -> float:
    pressure_score = 0.0
    
    # Market demand for current profession
    profession_demand = settlement.get_profession_demand(npc.occupation)
    if profession_demand < 0.3:
        pressure_score += 0.4
        npc.motivational_weights["survival"] += 0.3
    
    # Personal economic status
    if npc.economic_status == "struggling":
        pressure_score += 0.5
    elif npc.economic_status == "failing":
        pressure_score += 0.8
    
    # Age and physical capability decline
    if npc.age > 50 and npc.occupation in ["laborer", "soldier", "miner"]:
        pressure_score += 0.3
    
    # Family obligations
    if npc.has_dependents and npc.income < npc.calculate_family_needs():
        pressure_score += 0.4
    
    # Trigger career transition goal if pressure exceeds threshold
    if pressure_score > 0.6:
        npc.generate_goal("transition_to_sustainable_career")
    
    return pressure_score
```

**SKILL RECOGNITION TRIGGERS:**
```python
def evaluate_skill_recognition(npc: NPCProfile) -> str:
    # Check for secondary skills with high reputation
    for skill, reputation in npc.reputation_scores.items():
        if skill != npc.primary_profession and reputation > 0.6:
            if npc.professional_skills.get(skill, 0) > 0.4:
                return f"transition_to_{skill}_profession"
    
    # Discovery of hidden aptitudes
    for aptitude, level in npc.career_aptitudes.items():
        current_profession_aptitude = npc.get_profession_aptitude(npc.occupation)
        if level > current_profession_aptitude + 0.3:
            return f"explore_{aptitude}_career_options"
    
    return None
```

    return "trauma_driven_career_change"
```

ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
--------------------
**PROFESSION DEMAND MODELING:**
```python
def calculate_profession_demand(settlement: Settlement, profession: str) -> float:
    # Base demand based on settlement tier and population
    base_demand = settlement.get_tier_profession_demand(profession)
    
    # Economic factors

    # Competition factor (existing practitioners)
    competition_modifier = 1.0 / max(1, settlement.count_profession(profession))
    
    # Regional factors
    regional_modifier = settlement.region.get_profession_demand(profession)
    
    return base_demand * economic_modifier * resource_modifier * competition_modifier * regional_modifier
```

**INCOME CALCULATION:**
```python
def calculate_profession_income(npc: NPCProfile, settlement: Settlement) -> float:
    # Base income for profession
    base_income = settlement.get_profession_base_income(npc.occupation)
    
    # Skill modifier
    skill_level = npc.skills.get(npc.occupation, 0.1)
    skill_modifier = 0.5 + (skill_level * 1.5)  # 50% to 200% of base
    
    # Reputation modifier
    reputation = npc.reputation_scores.get("professional", 0.0)
    reputation_modifier = 1.0 + (reputation * 0.5)  # ±50% based on reputation
    
    # Market demand modifier
    demand = settlement.get_profession_demand(npc.occupation)
    demand_modifier = 0.5 + demand  # 50% to 150% based on demand
    
    # Competition modifier
    competition = settlement.get_profession_competition(npc.occupation)
    competition_modifier = max(0.3, 1.0 - competition)
    
    return base_income * skill_modifier * reputation_modifier * demand_modifier * competition_modifier
```

CAREER TRANSITION GOAL MANAGEMENT
----------------------------------

        required_skills_met = all(self.requirements_met.values())
        
        return self.progress >= required_progress and required_skills_met
```

SOCIAL NETWORK EVOLUTION
-------------------------
**RELATIONSHIP CHANGES DURING TRANSITION:**
```python
def update_relationships_for_career_change(npc: NPCProfile, old_profession: str, new_profession: str):
    # Relationships may weaken with old professional network
    for contact_name, relationship in npc.relationships.items():
        contact = get_npc_by_name(contact_name)
        if contact.occupation == old_profession:

        # Some relationships may strengthen (mentors, supporters)
        if contact.has_supported_career_change(npc):
            relationship["trust"] += 0.2
            relationship["gratitude"] += 0.3
    
    # Seek new relationships in target profession
    npc.add_goal(f"build_network_in_{new_profession}")
    
    # Potential mentor relationships
    experienced_practitioners = find_npcs_by_profession(new_profession)
    for practitioner in experienced_practitioners:
        if practitioner.skills[new_profession] > 0.7:
