# Age of Scribes - Social Simulation Engine (SSE)

**A comprehensive Python backend simulation engine for creating living, breathing social worlds with autonomous NPCs, dynamic settlements, emergent economies, and complex faction relationships.**

## üåü Overview

Age of Scribes SSE is a sophisticated social simulation engine designed to power narrative-driven games, interactive fiction, tabletop RPG campaigns, and educational simulations. The engine creates believable virtual societies where NPCs pursue their own goals, settlements evolve organically, economies respond to supply and demand, and factions vie for power - all without direct player intervention.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

- **Emergent Storytelling**: Complex narratives emerge naturally from simple rules and character interactions
- **Autonomous Behavior**: NPCs make decisions based on personality, memories, relationships, and circumstances
- **Living World**: The simulation continues to evolve even when players aren't actively engaged
- **Realistic Social Dynamics**: Characters form relationships, spread rumors, hold grudges, and build reputations
- **Dynamic Economy**: Resource production, trade networks, and economic pressures drive settlement development

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with game development or simulation concepts (helpful but not required)

### Quick Start

from simulation_manager import SimulationManager, SimulationConfig

# Create a complete simulation world
config = SimulationConfig(
    ticks_per_day=24,
    max_npcs=1000,
    guild_systems_enabled=True,
    justice_system_enabled=True
)

sim = SimulationManager(config)

# Define your world
settlements_config = [
    {
        "name": "Riverside",
        "population": 150,
        "location": [10.0, 20.0],
        "founding_year": 980
    }
]

npcs_config = [
    {
        "name": "Marcus the Merchant",
        "archetype": "merchant",
        "location": [10.0, 20.0]
    }

factions_config = [
    {
        "name": "Merchants Guild",
        "ideology": {"trade": 0.8, "prosperity": 0.7},
        "size": "large"
    }
]

# Initialize and run simulation
sim.create_world(settlements_config, npcs_config, factions_config)
sim.start_simulation()

# Run simulation steps
for day in range(10):
    for tick in range(24):
        results = sim.step_simulation()
        if results.get("day_advanced"):
            print(f"Day {results['day']} completed")
            # Access daily reports
            daily_report = sim.reporter.get_report(results['day'])
            print(f"Guild events: {len(daily_report.get('guild_events', []))}")
