NPC CAREER TRANSITION SYSTEM
============================

Dynamic Professional Mobility in Age of Scribes Social Simulation

OVERVIEW
========

The existing Age of Scribes social simulation engine provides robust support for NPCs to change careers and professions based on their experiences, motivations, and circumstances. This document outlines how career transitions work within our current systems and proposes minimal enhancements to fully realize this capability.

EXISTING SYSTEM SUPPORT
=======================

1. Motivation Engine Drivers
----------------------------
Our motivation system already supports career transitions through:

- SURVIVAL MOTIVATION: Economic hardship drives struggling artists to become merchants
- KNOWLEDGE MOTIVATION: Blacksmiths discovering ancient texts pursue scholarly work  
- WEALTH MOTIVATION: Poor farmers seek apprenticeships in lucrative trades
- FREEDOM MOTIVATION: Guild-restricted workers become independent craftspeople
- POWER MOTIVATION: Skilled workers pursue leadership or political positions
- REVENGE MOTIVATION: Wronged professionals seek careers that enable retribution
- COMMUNITY MOTIVATION: Isolated workers seek more social professions
- DUTY MOTIVATION: Personal calling drives career changes toward service

2. Faction Loyalty Consequences
-------------------------------
Faction dynamics create career disruption scenarios:

- GUILD DEFECTION: Leaving merchants guild forces finding new economic opportunities
- PROFESSIONAL BLACKLISTING: Low loyalty + faction punishment bars trade access
- FACTION COLLAPSE: Failed professional organizations force member career changes
- IDEOLOGICAL CONFLICTS: Values misalignment drives profession abandonment
- PROPAGANDA EFFECTS: Faction messaging can influence career aspirations
- LOYALTY REWARDS: High faction standing opens new professional opportunities

3. Reputation-Based Career Shifts
----------------------------------
Reputation system affects professional viability:

- DAMAGED PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION: Scandal forces career change
- CROSS-DIMENSIONAL SUCCESS: High personal reputation opens new career doors
- REGIONAL REPUTATION: Geographic relocation requires profession change
- NETWORK EFFECTS: Social connections enable or block career transitions
- RUMOR IMPACT: Professional rumors can destroy or enhance career prospects

4. Memory-Driven Career Evolution
---------------------------------
Memory system creates career change catalysts:

- TRAUMATIC WORK EXPERIENCES: Violence drives guards to become scholars
- DISCOVERY MEMORIES: Finding ancient texts sparks scholarly ambitions
- BETRAYAL MEMORIES: Professional betrayal motivates career escape
- SUCCESS MEMORIES: Achievement in side activities suggests new careers
- LEARNING MEMORIES: Educational experiences reveal hidden talents

CAREER TRANSITION MECHANICS
===========================

Triggering Events
-----------------
```
Economic Desperation:
if motivation_engine.motivational_weights["survival"] > 0.8:
    if npc_profile.economic_status == "struggling":
        generate_goal("find_more_profitable_work")

Professional Scandal:
if reputation_tracker.get_reputation("professional") < -0.5:
    generate_goal("rebuild_career_in_new_field")

Knowledge Discovery:
if recent_memory.context_tags.contains("discovery", "learning"):
    if motivation_engine.motivational_weights["knowledge"] > 0.7:
        generate_goal("pursue_scholarly_career")

Faction Exile:
if loyalty_engine.defection_reason == "professional_blacklist":
    generate_goal("establish_independent_practice")

Skill Recognition:
if reputation_tracker.get_reputation("secondary_skill") > 0.6:
    generate_goal("transition_to_recognized_talent")
```

Career Transition Process
-------------------------
1. MOTIVATION SHIFT: Life events change what drives the NPC
2. GOAL GENERATION: "Change profession to [new field]" becomes active goal
3. SKILL DEVELOPMENT: NPC pursues training/apprenticeship in new area
4. SOCIAL NETWORK CHANGES: New professional relationships form
5. IDENTITY EVOLUTION: Personality traits and beliefs adapt to new role
6. ECONOMIC ADAPTATION: Income and lifestyle adjust to new profession
7. REPUTATION REBUILDING: Professional standing established in new field

```

Career Transition Goal Management
---------------------------------
```python
class CareerTransitionGoal:
    def __init__(self, npc, target_profession, transition_reason):
        self.npc = npc
        self.target_profession = target_profession

        if self.progress > 0.8:
            self.execute_career_change()
    
    def execute_career_change(self):

        old_profession = self.npc.current_profession
        self.npc.career_history.append({

            "final_skill_level": self.npc.professional_skills[old_profession],
            "reputation_at_exit": self.npc.reputation.get_dimension("professional")
        })
        
        # Set new profession
        self.npc.current_profession = self.target_profession
        self.npc.professional_skills[self.target_profession] = max(0.3, 
            self.npc.professional_skills.get(self.target_profession, 0))
        
        # Reset professional reputation for new field
        self.npc.reputation.reset_dimension("professional", 0.0)
        
        # Update faction affiliations if necessary
        self.update_professional_affiliations()
        
        # Generate new career-appropriate goals
        self.npc.motivation_engine.generate_professional_goals(self.target_profession)

With minimal enhancements to track professional skills and economic pressures, the system can support realistic career mobility that enhances both individual character development and broader economic simulation.

This career transition system adds another layer of depth to NPC autonomy, creating more believable characters who adapt and evolve their professional lives in response to changing circumstances, personal growth, and social pressures.
