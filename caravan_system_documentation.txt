Caravan System Documentation
============================

The Caravan System is a modular resource transport simulation that creates dynamic
trade networks between settlements, enabling realistic economic interdependencies
and emergent trade behaviors in the Age of Scribes world.

## System Overview

### Purpose
The Caravan System simulates the transport of resources between settlements based on
supply and demand dynamics. It automatically generates caravans when settlements
have resource deficits and identifies suppliers with surpluses, creating realistic
trade networks that respond to economic conditions.

### Key Features
- Automatic caravan generation based on resource analysis
- Distance-based travel time calculation using Euclidean geometry
- Risk scoring system for future event integration (bandits, weather, etc.)
- Settlement integration with existing resource management
- Comprehensive status tracking and logging
- Modular design for easy integration with other systems

## Core Components

### Caravan Class
Represents individual caravans transporting resources between settlements.

**Attributes:**
- `origin_id`: Source settlement identifier
- `destination_id`: Target settlement identifier
- `resource_manifest`: Dictionary mapping resource types to quantities
- `departure_day`: Day the caravan began its journey
- `travel_duration`: Number of days required for travel
- `status`: Current caravan state ("in_transit", "delivered", "intercepted")
- `risk_score`: Risk factor (0-1) for potential events
- `id`: Unique 8-character identifier

**Methods:**
- `get_arrival_day()`: Calculate scheduled arrival day
- `get_progress(current_day)`: Get travel progress percentage
- `_calculate_cargo_value()`: Estimate total cargo value
- `_calculate_base_risk()`: Calculate base risk score

### Core Functions

#### generate_caravans(settlements, current_day)
Analyzes settlement resource needs and creates caravans to address deficits.

**Process:**
1. Identify settlements with resource deficits (>10% shortfall)
2. Find potential suppliers with surpluses within search range
3. Prioritize suppliers by surplus amount and proximity
4. Create caravans with appropriate cargo quantities
5. Update supplier resources (exports and stockpile reduction)

**Parameters:**
- Deficit threshold: 10% of daily consumption
- Search radius: 50 distance units maximum
- Minimum cargo: 5 units to justify caravan creation
- Surplus buffer: Suppliers maintain 20-day consumption buffer

#### resolve_caravans(caravans, settlements, current_day)
Processes caravans that have completed their journeys.

**Process:**
1. Check if caravans have reached their arrival day
2. Evaluate risk events (10% of risk score becomes actual risk)
3. For successful deliveries:
   - Add cargo to destination settlement imports
   - Update destination stockpiles
   - Mark caravan as delivered
4. Handle intercepted caravans (mark as intercepted)

## Integration with Settlement System

### Resource Analysis
The system analyzes each settlement's resource situation by comparing:
- Daily production + current imports vs. daily consumption
- Identifies deficits requiring external supply
- Calculates 10-day supply needs for deficit resources

### Settlement Location Usage
Utilizes settlement `location` tuples for:
- Distance calculation between settlements (Euclidean formula)
- Travel time determination (base speed: 2 distance units per day)
- Supplier prioritization (closer suppliers preferred)

### Resource Management Integration
- Updates supplier `export_volume` and reduces `stockpile` when caravan departs
- Adds to destination `import_volume` and `stockpile` upon delivery
- Maintains existing ResourceType enum compatibility
- Preserves all existing settlement resource tracking

## Risk System

### Risk Score Calculation
Base risk factors:
- Cargo value (higher value = higher risk)
- Distance (longer routes = higher risk)
- Future expansion: route type, weather, political stability

### Risk Events
Current implementation includes simple interception events:
- 10% of risk score becomes actual event probability
- Intercepted caravans lose their cargo
- Future expansion: delays, partial losses, ransom demands

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity
- Caravan generation: O(S²×R) where S=settlements, R=resources
- Distance calculation: O(1) per settlement pair
- Resolution: O(C) where C=active caravans
- Memory usage: ~200 bytes per active caravan

### Scalability Targets
- Optimal: 10-100 settlements with 50-200 active caravans
- Maximum tested: 1,000 settlements with realistic performance
- Processing time: <10ms per generation cycle for 100 settlements

## Configuration Parameters

### Economic Thresholds
- Deficit threshold: 10% of daily consumption triggers caravan request
- Surplus buffer: Suppliers maintain 20-day consumption reserve
- Minimum cargo: 5 units minimum to justify caravan creation
- Maximum cargo: 30% of supplier surplus per caravan

### Geographic Constraints
- Maximum search distance: 50 units
- Base travel speed: 2 distance units per day
- Minimum travel time: 1 day regardless of distance

### Risk Parameters
- Base risk calculation: cargo_value / 1000.0 (capped at 1.0)
- Event probability: 10% of risk score
- Future expansion hooks for weather, politics, route quality

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Integration
```python
from caravan_system import generate_caravans, resolve_caravans

# In daily game loop
new_caravans = generate_caravans(settlements, current_day)
active_caravans.extend(new_caravans)
resolve_caravans(active_caravans, settlements, current_day)
```

### Economy Tick Integration
```python
# Within economy_tick_system.py
def _process_caravan_routes(self, settlements: List[Settlement]):
    """Process caravan route effects on settlements."""
    new_caravans = generate_caravans(settlements, self.current_day)
    self.caravan_routes.extend(new_caravans)
    resolve_caravans(self.caravan_routes, settlements, self.current_day)
```

### Advanced Tracking
```python
# Track caravan statistics
active_count = len([c for c in caravans if c.status == "in_transit"])
delivered_count = len([c for c in caravans if c.status == "delivered"])
intercepted_count = len([c for c in caravans if c.status == "intercepted"])

# Monitor trade routes
route_map = {}
for caravan in caravans:
    route = (caravan.origin_id, caravan.destination_id)
    route_map[route] = route_map.get(route, 0) + 1
```

## Event Generation and Logging

### Caravan Events
The system generates detailed logs for:
- Caravan creation with origin, destination, and cargo details
- Successful deliveries with travel time and cargo value
- Interception events with risk factors
- Route establishment between settlement pairs

### Economic Impact Tracking
Caravans provide valuable economic data:
- Trade flow volumes between settlements
- Resource shortage identification
- Economic interdependency mapping
- Transport efficiency metrics
