ADVANCED EXTENSIONS (Our Recent Work)
====================================

8. NPC Motivation Engine (Extended npc_ai.py)
----------------------------------------------
Purpose: Dynamic personal goal generation and motivation-driven behavior

Key Features:
- 8 Core Motivations: survival, revenge, community, power, knowledge, wealth, duty, freedom
- Dynamic Goal System: Goals with urgency, progress tracking, and type classification
- Experience-Driven Evolution: Memories reshape motivational priorities over time

- Personality traits determine loyalty susceptibility and defection patterns

SYSTEM INTEGRATION & EMERGENT BEHAVIOR
======================================

Cross-System Data Flow:
Memory Core ←→ NPC Behavior ←→ Motivation Engine
     ↕              ↕              ↕
Rumor Engine ←→ Reputation ←→ Faction Loyalty
     ↕              ↕              ↕
Justice System ←→ Faction AI ←→ Faction Generator

Integration Examples:
1. Memory → Motivation → Behavior: Betrayal memory increases revenge motivation, leading to confrontational behavior
2. Rumor → Reputation → Justice: Corruption rumors damage reputation, affecting legal proceedings
3. Faction Events → Loyalty → Behavior: Faction victories boost loyalty, increasing compliance and risk-taking
4. Justice → Memory → Faction Loyalty: Legal outcomes create memories that reshape faction trust

EMERGENT STORYTELLING CAPABILITIES
==================================

Character Arc Examples:

The Disillusioned Guard:
- Starts loyal to city watch (0.7 loyalty)
- Discovers corruption → loyalty drops
- Personal betrayal by colleague → revenge motivation spikes
- Family threatened → defection triggered
- Becomes independent investigator with vendetta

The Pragmatic Merchant:
- Joins guild for economic benefits
- Loyalty fluctuates with material gains/losses
- Broken promises → skepticism increases
- Switches to rival organization for better opportunities
- Develops pattern of faction opportunism

The Scholarly Researcher:
- High knowledge motivation drives daily activities
- Discovery memories boost research goals
- Resource scarcity triggers survival concerns
- Balances intellectual pursuits with practical needs
- Creates knowledge-sharing networks across factions

Emergent Political Dynamics:
- Corruption Scandals: Single corrupt memory spreads through rumor network, eroding faction loyalty across multiple NPCs
- Loyalty Cascades: Faction victories boost loyalty; defeats trigger defection waves
- Propaganda Wars: Competing factions use different tactics based on target personalities
- Underground Networks: Defected NPCs form informal alliances against former factions
